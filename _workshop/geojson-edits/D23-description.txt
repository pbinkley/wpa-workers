This area's development first occurred along the main east-west thoroughfares of St. Clair and Superior Aves. some 15 yrs. ago. The portion of area north of St. Clair was formerly the village of Glenville, also site of the famous Glenville Race Track which was purchasod by Wm. Crawford about 1912 and developed with homes. Area lying between St. Clair and Superior was first developed by the Deming Bros., beginning about 1905, along both sides of E. 105th St. and, following the natural growth of Cleveland, was heavily developed between 1905-15 by other promoters. Original occupants of this section were of American stock and community was very desirable but between the period 1920-30 a wholesale shift of population occurred, original owners moving to the Hghts. section of Cleveland, and homes then were purchased by Russian Orthodox Jewish from the 55th-Woodland section; also during that period an influx of approx. 100 colored families occurred (some scattered throughout the area), although principally in properties abutting E. 105th and concentrated in two blocks of E. 124rd St. close to Superior (caused by one promoter who built homes for sale to colored). Since thet time Jewish ownership has continuously increased, now also controlling the commercial structures scattered along E. 105th St., plus their development of social centers and synagogue. Following the depression, foreclosures were very heavy in this area and some properties were sold to colored, particularly where adjacent colored occupancy existed. This has accounted for an increase of 173 colored families in the neighborhood during the past 4-5 yrs. However, institutions now have mutually agreed not to sell to colored but the presence of colored scattered throughout the area has taken its toll on values and numerous \"for sale\" signs furnish evidence that more desirable occupants are leaving this section. Despite unwillingness of institutions to sell to colored, several realtors have commented on the fact that some descendents of original Orthodox Jewish occupants in this area have not been unwilling to sell to colored and this constitutes a further threat to price values. Two-family homes are scattered throughout area, principally concentrated along side streets close to E. 105th and built in rows of 10-12 in the southern part of area. Orthodox Jewish ownership is heaviest in that portion north of St. Clair. Some infiltration of Italian from the southeast abutting 4th grade area has occurred into this section. Rentals in this fully built-up, heavily-occupied area remain good due to proximity to neighborhood conveniences and good transportation on E. 105th St. Were it not for the above information, this area, to the casual observer, would appear to be a good 3rd grade neighborhood because of several wide streets, large shade trees and good homes (Drexel; Grantwood); although area on the whole shows lack of maintenance. It is difficult to forecast the future of this area but the fact that mortgage funds are not available, institutional holdings are large, majority of occupants are not maintaining properties and desirable residents are leaving indicate that this is an area that has just reached 4th grade and will continue to decline. With respect to colored occupancy in this security area, U.S. Post Office survey revealed that there were 273 colored families located by street as follows:

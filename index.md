This site is a preliminary sharing of some research on a WPA white-collar project in Cleveland. It uses a letter signed by 73 workers in the Court Records project to establish a set of demographic data from the 1940 census as a entry point to investigating the conditions of the workers and their engagement with the project. It is very much a work in progress.

### The Letter

> Cleveland, Ohio  
> April 12, 1940

> We, the undersigned, workers on the Court Records Digest Project, under the supervision of William Hutchins, desire to express our sincerest sympathy with Mrs. Binkley for the untimely death of Dr. Robert Binkley, and our deep sense of loss to W.P.A. Research.

> We, who know no desperate words or acts, no ultimatums, nor any easier alternatives, have, through the greatness of his mind and heart and enthusiasm, been allowed to work with the hope that each may be rendered his or her reward "according as his work is."

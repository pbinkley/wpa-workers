> April 12, 1940

> We, the undersigned, workers on the Court Records Digest Project, under the supervision of William Hutchins, desire to express our sincerest sympathy with Mrs. Binkley for the untimely death of Dr. Robert Binkley, and our deep sense of loss to W.P.A. Research.

> We, who know no desperate words or acts, no ultimatums, nor any easier alternatives, have, through the greatness of his mind and heart and enthusiasm, been allowed to work with the hope that each may be rendered his or her reward "according as his work is."
